# SnakeTheGame
Now this is the story
all about how 
my life got twisted
upside-down
and if you'd like to take a minute
just sit right there
I'll tell you all about how
I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

West-Philadelphia born and raised
at the playground I spent most of my days
shootin hoops ouside of school
when a couole of guys who were up to no good
started making trouble in my neighbourhood
I got in one little fight
and my mom got scared she said
you're moving to your aunt and uncle up in Bel-Air
